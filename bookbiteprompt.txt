I want to build a browser-based chat application where I can upload books 
and have AI-powered conversations about them. I'm a complete beginner to 
coding.

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:

1. TECH STACK:
   - Frontend: React with modern hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef)
   - Styling: Tailwind CSS for clean, responsive design
   - File handling: Support for .txt files initially (we'll add PDF later)
   - AI Integration: Anthropic Claude API (I'll provide the API key)

2. FEATURES NEEDED:

   Phase 1 (Build this first):
   - Clean chat interface with message history
   - File upload button to load book files (.txt format)
   - Display which book is currently loaded
   - Text input with send button
   - Messages display in conversation format (user right, AI left)
   - Loading indicator when AI is thinking
   - Clear chat button

   Phase 2 (We'll add later):
   - Connect to Anthropic Claude API
   - Include book content in AI prompts
   - Handle longer books by chunking content
   - Add PDF support using pdf-parse library
   - Save conversation history

3. CODE STRUCTURE:
   - Use functional React components
   - Keep state management simple with useState
   - Write clean, well-commented code so I can learn
   - Use modern ES6+ JavaScript syntax

4. UI DESIGN:
   - Modern, clean interface
   - Good contrast and readability
   - Mobile responsive
   - Pleasant color scheme (blues/purples suggested)
   - Clear visual feedback for all actions

5. SPECIFIC TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
   - FileReader API for reading uploaded files
   - Proper error handling for file uploads
   - Scroll to bottom when new messages arrive
   - Enter key to send messages
   - Disable send button when empty or loading

STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:

Step 1: Set up a new React app using create-react-app
Step 2: Create the main App component with all necessary state
Step 3: Build the UI with three sections: header, messages area, input area
Step 4: Implement file upload functionality
Step 5: Create message sending and display logic
Step 6: Add placeholder for AI responses (we'll connect real AI next)
Step 7: Style everything with Tailwind

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Start with simulated AI responses (just echo back with a note)
- Make sure I can upload a .txt file and see it load
- Add helpful comments explaining what each part does
- Use icons from lucide-react library
- Keep the code in a single App.js file for now

Please create the complete project structure and walk me through:
1. What commands to run to set it up
2. What files to create/modify
3. How to run the app locally
4. What each major code section does

After this is working, we'll add:
- Real Anthropic Claude API integration
- PDF file support
- Conversation persistence
- Multiple book management
